# Machine Learning for Spotify Track Popularity

This project explores the relationship between audio features and song popularity on Spotify
using supervised machine learning techniques.

The goal is to build a multiclass classification model capable of predicting popularity levels
based on musical and acoustic characteristics.

## Context
Academic project – Machine Learning course  
Bachelor’s Degree in Artificial Intelligence – University of Pavia - Milano Statale - Milano Bicocca

## Dataset
- Spotify tracks dataset
- Audio features (e.g. danceability, energy, tempo)
- Popularity score discretized into classes

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature analysis and engineering
3. Model selection and training
4. Performance evaluation using cross-validation

## Results
- Classical ML models were able to capture meaningful correlations between audio features
  and popularity
- Feature importance analysis highlighted key musical attributes influencing popularity

## Notes
This project focuses on methodological understanding rather than production deployment.
