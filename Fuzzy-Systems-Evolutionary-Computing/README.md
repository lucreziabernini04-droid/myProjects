# Fuzzy Systems & Evolutionary Computing

This project explores fuzzy logic systems and evolutionary optimization algorithms
to solve function approximation tasks.

The focus is on understanding how fuzzy inference systems can be combined with
optimization techniques to automatically tune model parameters.

## Context
