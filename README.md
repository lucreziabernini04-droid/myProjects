# My Projects – Lucrezia Bernini

This repository collects selected academic and hackathon projects developed during my
Bachelor’s degree in Artificial Intelligence.

The projects span multiple areas of AI, including Natural Language Processing, Machine
Learning, Deep Learning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and AI system design.
Each folder contains a standalone project with code, documentation, and results.

## Projects

### Natural Language Processing
- **NLP-AIMedQA**  
  Medical Question Answering project comparing fine-tuning and prompt-based approaches
  using transformer models (T5, SciFive, Flan-T5, Phi-3-mini), evaluated with ROUGE, BLEU,
  and BERTScore.

### Machine Learning
- **ML-Spotify-Popularity**  
  Supervised machine learning analysis of Spotify track popularity using audio features
  and classical ML pipelines.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation & AI Systems
- **Hackathon-Lausanne**  
  Civic RAG chatbot retrieving information from official Canton of Vaud PDFs and web
  content, built with an open-source LLM (Apertus), Streamlit interface, Docker deployment,
  and optional text-to-speech output for accessibility.

- **Hackathon-Innovaite**  
  AI assistant designed to simplify navigation of university websites through RAG-based
  retrieval and automatic email generation. Implemented both as a Chrome browser extension
  and as a native website integration, reducing help desk workload and improving user
  experience.

### Core AI & Optimization
- **Fuzzy-Systems-Evolutionary-Computing**  
  Function approximation using fuzzy logic systems optimized with evolutionary algorithms,
  including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

### Deep Learning
- **Deep-Learning-Hotel-Reviews**  
  Multi-input, multi-head neural network for joint prediction of hotel review type and
  rating, demonstrating multi-task learning techniques.
