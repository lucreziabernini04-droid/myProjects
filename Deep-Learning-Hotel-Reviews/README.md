# Deep Learning for Hotel Review Analysis

This project focuses on predicting both the type and rating of hotel reviews using
a deep learning approach based on a multi-input, multi-head neural network.

The model jointly learns multiple outputs, capturing different aspects of user
feedback from textual and structured features.

## Context
Academic project – Deep Learning  
Bachelor’s Degree in Artificial Intelligence – University of Pavia - Milano Statale - Milano Bicocca (Jun 2025)

## Problem
Given hotel review data, the goal is to:
- Classify the review type
- Predict the associated rating

## Model Architecture
- Multi-input neural network
- Multi-head output architecture
- Shared feature representations across tasks

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Neural network design with multiple inputs
- Joint training for multi-task learning
- Performance evaluation on classification and regression outputs

## Results
- The multi-head architecture enabled effective joint learning
- Shared representations improved generalization across tasks
- The model successfully captured relationships between review content and ratings

## Notes
This project highlights the use of multi-task deep learning architectures for
complex prediction problems.
